**Whisker Wisdom:** Test Your *Knowlwdge*, Uncover Feline *Facts*!

An interactive and engaging quiz designed to challenge and grow your expertise on all things feline. Explore a variety of topics, from quirky cat behaviors to fascinating feline facts, and sharpen your knowledge about our whiskered companions. Perfect for cat lovers and curious minds alike!

## UX

Whisker Wisdom was developed with the aim of providing cat enthusiasts and curious minds a fun, interactive way to explore the fascinating world of felines. Understanding the diverse range of cat lovers, from seasoned pet owners to those simply intrigued by these captivating creatures, the application was designed to cater to all knowledge levels.

With a user-friendly interface, the app offers a seamless experience for all age groups, ensuring that the focus remains on learning and enjoyment. The interactive quizzes and engaging trivia provide a perfect balance between education and entertainment, allowing users to deepen their understanding of cat behaviors, fun facts, and more.

The design draws inspiration from simplicity and accessibility, ensuring that users can easily navigate through the content while discovering the wonderful world of cats in a visually appealing and intuitive environment.

### Colour Scheme

In designing Whisker Wisdom, I focused on creating a warm and inviting atmosphere, reflecting the playful and affectionate nature of our feline friends. After careful consideration, I selected a combination of orange and purple as the primary colors, as these tones evoke a sense of warmth, creativity, and comfort, enhancing the overall user experience.

Orange, associated with warmth and energy, was chosen to reflect the playful and lively spirit of cats, while purple conveys a sense of curiosity and mystery, perfectly aligning with the theme of uncovering fun and surprising feline facts. Together, these colors create a cozy and approachable feel, making users feel right at home as they explore the quizzes.

I used[coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to generate my colour palette

The chosen colors not only enhance the aesthetic of the app but also guide the user experience. For example, green indicates correct answers, while red signals incorrect ones, providing instant feedback during the quiz.

### Typography

For the typography in Whisker Wisdom, I selected the [Mali](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mali?query=Mali) font, a playful yet legible typeface that perfectly complements the warm and friendly atmosphere of the quiz. Sourced from Google Fonts, Mali’s rounded and slightly handwritten style offers a welcoming and approachable feel, making it an ideal choice for an application centered around fun and discovery.

## Development Story

This section outlines the development process of the Quiz Application. The objective is to create an engaging platform where users can answer a series of questions, receive feedback on their performance, and navigate seamlessly between different sections of the app. The development story is organized into distinct features that were implemented to achieve this functionality.

- **Setting Up Navigation Between Pages**

  **Objective**: Enable users to navigate smoothly between the index, intro, quiz, and result pages.

  To facilitate user navigation, I implemented functions that redirect users to different sections of the application. These functions are triggered by button clicks, providing an intuitive user experience.

  ```js
  // Function to navigate from index to intro page
  function navigateToIntro() {
      window.location.href = 'intro.html';
  }

  // Function to navigate from intro to quiz page
  function navigateToQuiz() {
      window.location.href = 'quiz.html';
  }

  // Function to navigate back to the index page
  function navigateToHome() {
      window.location.href = 'index.html';
  }
  ```

- **Initializing and Managing the Quiz Flow**

  **Objective**: Manage the quiz state, including current question number, score tracking, and transitioning between questions.

  I developed a comprehensive quiz management system that initializes the quiz, displays questions, handles user selections, updates scores, and navigates to the result page upon completion.

  ```js
  // Function to initialise the quiz
  function startQuiz() {
      currentQuestionNo = 0;
      score = 0;
      showQuestion();
      updateProgressText();
  }

  // Function to show the current question
  function showQuestion() {
      resetState();
      let currentQuestion = quizData[currentQuestionNo];
      questionIndex.innerHTML = currentQuestionNo + 1;
      questionText.innerHTML = currentQuestion.question;

      currentQuestion.answers.forEach(answer => {
          const li = document.createElement("li");
          li.innerHTML = answer.text;
          li.classList.add("list-group-item", "custom-list-item", "mb-4", "rounded", "py-4");
          answerList.appendChild(li);
          if (answer.correct) {
              li.dataset.correct = answer.correct;
          }
          li.addEventListener("click", selectAnswer)
      });
  }

  // Function to reset the state between questions
  function resetState() {
      nextButton.style.setProperty('display', 'none', 'important');
      while (answerList.firstChild) {
          answerList.removeChild(answerList.firstChild);
      }
  }
  ```

- **Handling Answer Selection and Scoring**

  **Objective**: Allow users to select answers, provide immediate feedback, and accurately track their scores.

  I implemented an interactive answer selection mechanism that visually indicates correct and incorrect choices, disables further selections after an answer is chosen, and updates the user's score accordingly.

  ```js
  // Function to handle answer selection
  function selectAnswer(e) {
      const selectedOption = e.target;
      const isCorrect = selectedOption.dataset.correct === "true";
      if (isCorrect) {
          selectedOption.classList.add("bg-success");
          score++;
      } else {
          selectedOption.classList.add("bg-danger");
      }
      Array.from(answerList.children).forEach(option => {
          if (option.dataset.correct === "true") {
              option.classList.add("bg-success");
          }
          option.classList.add("disabled-option");
      });
      nextButton.style.setProperty('display', 'block', 'important');
  }
  ```

- **Displaying Progress and Navigating Through Questions**

  **Objective**: Provide users with real-time feedback on their progress through the quiz and enable them to proceed to the next question or view results upon completion.

  I integrated a progress indicator that updates as users answer questions and implemented a `nextQuestion` function to handle the transition between questions or to the result page.

  ```js
  // Function to handle answer selection
  // Function to show next question or end the quiz
  function nextQuestion() {
      currentQuestionNo++;
      if (currentQuestionNo < quizData.length) {
          showQuestion();
          updateProgressText();
      } else {
          showResult();
      }
  }

  // Function to update the progress text
  function updateProgressText() {
      if (progressText) {
          progressText.innerHTML = `${currentQuestionNo + 1} of ${totalQuestions} questions`
      }
  }

  // Add event listener to the next button (for the quiz page)
  if (nextButton) {
      nextButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
          if (currentQuestionNo < quizData.length - 1) { 
              nextQuestion();
          } else {
              showResult(); 
          }
      });
  }
  ```

- **Result Calculation and Display**

  **Objective**: Calculate the user's final score and display personalized feedback based on their performance.

  I created a result display system that retrieves the user's score from `localStorage`, determines pass or fail status, and presents corresponding messages and images.

  ```js
  // Function to show the result (pass or fail)
  function showResult() {
      localStorage.setItem('quizScore', score);
      window.location.href = 'result.html';
  }

  // Function to display the result on the result page
  function displayResult() {
      let score = localStorage.getItem('quizScore') || 0;

      if (score >= 5) {
          resultTitle.innerHTML = "Good Job";
          resultImage.src = "assets/images/pass.png";
      } else {
          resultTitle.innerHTML = "Fur-get About It!";
          resultImage.src = "assets/images/fail.png";
      }

      resultScore.innerHTML = `Your score is ${score}/${totalQuestions}`;
  }

  // Check if we are on the result page
  if (resultTitle && resultImage && resultScore) {
      displayResult();
      if (retryButton) {
          retryButton.addEventListener('click', navigateToQuiz);
      }
      if (homeButton) {
          homeButton.addEventListener('click', navigateToHome)
      }
  }
  ```
