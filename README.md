**Whisker Wisdom:** Test Your *Knowlwdge*, Uncover Feline *Facts*!

An interactive and engaging quiz designed to challenge and grow your expertise on all things feline. Explore a variety of topics, from quirky cat behaviors to fascinating feline facts, and sharpen your knowledge about our whiskered companions. Perfect for cat lovers and curious minds alike!

## UX

Whisker Wisdom was developed with the aim of providing cat enthusiasts and curious minds a fun, interactive way to explore the fascinating world of felines. Understanding the diverse range of cat lovers, from seasoned pet owners to those simply intrigued by these captivating creatures, the application was designed to cater to all knowledge levels.

With a user-friendly interface, the app offers a seamless experience for all age groups, ensuring that the focus remains on learning and enjoyment. The interactive quizzes and engaging trivia provide a perfect balance between education and entertainment, allowing users to deepen their understanding of cat behaviors, fun facts, and more.

The design draws inspiration from simplicity and accessibility, ensuring that users can easily navigate through the content while discovering the wonderful world of cats in a visually appealing and intuitive environment.

### Colour Scheme

In designing Whisker Wisdom, I focused on creating a warm and inviting atmosphere, reflecting the playful and affectionate nature of our feline friends. After careful consideration, I selected a combination of orange and purple as the primary colors, as these tones evoke a sense of warmth, creativity, and comfort, enhancing the overall user experience.

Orange, associated with warmth and energy, was chosen to reflect the playful and lively spirit of cats, while purple conveys a sense of curiosity and mystery, perfectly aligning with the theme of uncovering fun and surprising feline facts. Together, these colors create a cozy and approachable feel, making users feel right at home as they explore the quizzes.

The chosen colors not only enhance the aesthetic of the app but also guide the user experience. For example, green indicates correct answers, while red signals incorrect ones, providing instant feedback during the quiz.

### Typography

For the typography in Whisker Wisdom, I selected the [Mali](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mali?query=Mali) font, a playful yet legible typeface that perfectly complements the warm and friendly atmosphere of the quiz. Sourced from Google Fonts, Maliâ€™s rounded and slightly handwritten style offers a welcoming and approachable feel, making it an ideal choice for an application centered around fun and discovery.
