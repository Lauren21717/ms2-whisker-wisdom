## Automated Testing
Although automated testing is valuable for maintaining code quality, implementing it for the quiz functionality in this project would be overly complex. The quiz relies heavily on DOM manipulation and Bootstrap, making accurate simulation in a test environment challenging.

Given the project's scope and time constraints, we opted for thorough manual testing to ensure the quiz operates correctly.

In larger or more complex projects, investing in a robust automated testing setup may be justified. For future iterations or similar projects, automated tests could enhance long-term maintainability and help catch regressions early in development.


## User Feedback
